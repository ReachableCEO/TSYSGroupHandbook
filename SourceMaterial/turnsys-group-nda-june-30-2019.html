Mutual Nondisclosure. “Disclosing Party” describes each party with respect to <br />Confidential Information it discloses to the other party. “Receiving Party” describes each <br />party with respect to Confidential Information it receives from the other party. <br />2. Purpose. The parties anticipate disclosure of Confidential Information for the purpose on <br />the accompanying standard form certificate (the “Purpose”). <br />3.

Receiving Party shall use Confidential Information only to advance <br />the Purpose. <br />(d) Security Measures.

If legally permitted, Receiving <br />Party shall promptly notify Disclosing Party of the nature of the <br />requirement and the Confidential Information affected.
