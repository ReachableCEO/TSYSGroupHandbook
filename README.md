# TSYS Group Handbook

## Repo Description
In 2011 we set out to bring internet to all for $5.00 per user, per month. We knew back then to do that that we had to first create a whole new kind of organization place that was designed to foster that goal. Where true north was constantly present and permeated all we do. We also knew we couldn't have middle management and that ownership/control/leadership had to be fully distributed throughout the organization. "Headquarters" such as it is, exists only to serve the members in their mission execution.

We want an organization where incredibly talented individuals are empowered to put their best work into the hands of billions of people, with very little in their way.

This book is an abbreviated encapsulation of our guiding principles. As TSYS Group grows, we hope that these principles will serve each new member joining our ranks.

If you are new to TSYS Group, welcome. Although the goals in this book are important, it’s really member ideas, talent, and energy that will keep TSYS Group shining in the years ahead.

Thanks for being here. Let’s make great things.
